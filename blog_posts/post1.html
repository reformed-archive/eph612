    <h1>Understanding Reformed Theology</h1>
    
    <p>Reformed Theology, rooted in the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, emphasizes God’s sovereignty, the authority of Scripture, and salvation by grace through faith. It has shaped much of the Christian tradition, influencing churches, theology, and culture across centuries.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>God’s Sovereignty:</strong> God is in complete control over all creation and history.</li>
        <li><strong>Scripture Alone:</strong> The Bible is the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice.</li>
        <li><strong>Salvation by Grace:</strong> Salvation is a gift from God, received through faith, not earned by works.</li>
        <li><strong>The Five Points of Calvinism (TULIP):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Total Depravity</li>
                <li>Unconditional Election</li>
                <li>Limited Atonement</li>
                <li>Irresistible Grace</li>
                <li>Perseverance of the Saints</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Reformed Theology offers a framework for understanding God’s plan and purpose. It encourages believers to trust in God’s wisdom and to live in gratitude for the gift of salvation. Its rich tradition continues to influence preaching, worship, and Christian thought today.</p>
